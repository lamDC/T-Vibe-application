## Purpose
This research is being done by team Alan T to make sure that the API that Youtube provides can give us the data that we need for T-Vibe.
## Main and sub questions
### Main question
The main question is: Which aspects of the Youtube API can be used for this project?</br>

### Sub questions
The sub questions are:
1. How can these aspects be implemented in this project?
2. What are some technical pros and cons about the Youtube API?

## Elaboration
### What are some technical pros and cons about the Youtube API?
Pros:
1. The Youtube data API has very in depth documentation.
2. Using the Youtube data API is very secure since it needs to pass through the Google API first. The Google API forces you to use Oauth 2.0

Cons:
1. Since the Youtube data API is more of a video platform than a music platform it does not give the genres of a song back.
2. You have to first connect to the Google API before you can access the Youtube data API.

The Youtube data API gives us (with the exception of genres) what we need in T-Vibe. The Youtube data API is also very secure to use.

### How can these aspects be implemented in this project?
A prototype has been build to get a music video from Youtube using the Youtube data API.
The prototype can be found in this very same research folder.

## Conclusion
The Youtube data API is definitely a useful tool for T-Vibe since it is a secure way of getting the information of music videos that we need.
