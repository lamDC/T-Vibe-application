# Running the T-Vibe server

1. *Download and install the software:*
   - If you haven't already: install version 8.4 (or higher) of Node.js. Use either [this Windows tutorial](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-nodejs-tutorial-windows/)
     or [this MacOS tutorial](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-nodejs-tutorial-mac-os-x/)
   - Install MongoDB version 3.4 or higher. There are [instructions for Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) and [instructions for MacOS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/). MacOS users: we recommend using the 'HomeBrew' method described in the MacOS instructions. You'll have to install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) first
2. *Start the application:*
